description = Improving the venerable RV-105 seemed like a daunting task, and STEADLER Corps engineers wasted many hours arguing over the best way to do it. One of those options was altering the angle of the nozzles. The engineer responsible argued it would allow for increased translation thrust, but no one believed him.
